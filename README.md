Pistachio is my take on the chernos game engine series. My goal is, to make a more advanced version of it. 

## Getting Started
You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheRealFirst/Pistachio`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!

(Based on The Chernos Game Engine Series and Hazel)
